# Lab Code

You can follow along with the TA's tutorial by running the chunks below. 

```{r tryIt1, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to print the phrase "Hello World!" to the screen
print("Hello world!")
```

```{r tryIt2, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to compute what 5 times 7 is
5 * 7
```

```{r tryIt3, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to compute what 36 divided by 6 is, and assign it to x
x <- 36 / 6
```

```{r tryIt4, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to see the value of x that R has stored
x
```

```{r tryIt5, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to see what happens if you use X (capitalized) instead
X
```

```{r tryIt6, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to load the penguins data set into the environment
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv")
```

```{r tryIt7, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to peek at the penguins data set
head(penguins)
```

```{r tryIt8, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to examine the structure of the penguins data set
str(penguins)
```

# Code Cheat Sheet

## `<-`
- Assigns a value to a name
- `name <- value`

## `read.csv(file, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)`
- `file` is the name of the file from which data are to be read
- `stringsAsFactors` should generally be set to `TRUE` (all caps): this determines how text-like data in a CSV file is interpreted by R.

## `head(x, n)`
- `x` is a data.frame
- `n` is the number of rows to print

## `str(object)`
- `object` is the R object about which you want to have some information (i.e., see the `str`ucture of).
