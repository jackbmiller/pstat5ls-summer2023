# Introduction

In this lab report, you will use `pnorm()` and `qnorm()` to find probabilities and quantiles for normal distributions.

## Question 1
It is known that SAT scores for the 2021-2022 academic year were approximately normal, with a mean of 1050 and a standard deviation of 216 points. 

What is the probability that a randomly selected SAT test taker in the 2021-2022 year scored 1400 or higher?

# Question 1 answer

```{r question1, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to calculate the probability that a randomly selected 
# SAT test taker in the 2021-2022 year scored 1400 or higher. Do not start 
# your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a 
# comment, R will ignore it).

pnorm(q = 1400, mean = 1050, sd = 216, lower.tail = FALSE)



```

The probability that a randomly selected SAT test-taker in the 2021-22 year scored 1400 or higher is 0.053.

## Question 2
It is known that SAT scores for the 2021-2022 academic year were approximately normal, with a mean of 1050 and a standard deviation of 216 points. 

What score would an SAT test taker in the 2021-2022 year need to get in order to be in top 5% of SAT scores?

```{r question2, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to find the score that an SAT test taker in the
# 2021-2022 year would need to get in order to be in top 5% of SAT scores
# Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with #
# (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

qnorm(p = 0.95, mean = 1050, sd = 216, lower.tail = TRUE)

# OR

qnorm(p = 0.05, mean = 1050, sd = 216, lower.tail = FALSE)

```

To be in the top 5% of SAT scores in the 2021-22 year, an SAT test taker would need to score 1405.288 or more.

## Question 3
Arsenic is a compound that occurs naturally in very low concentrations. Arsenic blood concentrations in healthy adults have a normal distribution with mean 3.2 micrograms per deciliter ($\mu$g/dl) and standard deviation 1.5 $\mu$g/dl. 

What is the probability that a healthy adult will have an arsenic blood concentration between 2.5 and 5 micrograms per deciliter? 

```{r question3, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to find the probability that a healthy adult will 
# have an arsenic blood concentration between 2.5 and 5 micrograms per 
# deciliter. # Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your 
# code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

pnorm(q = 5, mean = 3.2, sd = 1.5, lower.tail = TRUE) - 
  pnorm(q = 2.5, mean = 3.2, sd = 1.5, lower.tail = TRUE)


```

The probability that a healthy adult will have an arsenic blood concentration between 2.5 and 5 micrograms per deciliter is 0.565.

## Question 4
Arsenic is a compound that occurs naturally in very low concentrations. Arsenic blood concentrations in healthy adults have a normal distribution with mean 3.2 micrograms per deciliter ($\mu$g/dl) and standard deviation 1.5 $\mu$g/dl. 

What is the range of arsenic blood concentrations for the middle 50% of healthy adults? 

```{r question4, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to find the range of arsenic blood concentrations 
# for the middle 50% of healthy adults. 
# Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with #
# (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

upperbound <- qnorm(p = 0.75, mean = 3.2, sd = 1.5, lower.tail = TRUE)
lowerbound <- qnorm(p = 0.25, mean = 3.2, sd = 1.5, lower.tail = TRUE)
upperbound
lowerbound

```

The range of arsenic blood concentrations for the middle 50% of healthy adults is from 2.188 to 4.212 micrograms per deciliter.
